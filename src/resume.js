The role entailed developing a relationship with Sogeti and Capgemini and becoming a trusted advisor over time.  Working with the IBM/Capgemini/Sogeti Alliance team this goal was achieved.  Sogeti has realized the benefits of the alliance relationship and has started an IBM practice of consultants to focus solely on solutions around IBM products.  Sogeti managers looked to me for direction and guidance when implementing IBM solutions they had little or no experience with and sought my advice on many new proposals.  Capgemini has realized some benefits as well.  Being more of a thought leadership organzation, Capgemini has utlized my abilities more as an advisor in specific areas or on RFPs as guidance when bidding on unfamiliar products.  Notably during this time period I accomplished the following:",

				"I helped Sogeti to close a million dollar software and services deal that unseated IBM Global Services as contractor of choice at Ameritas Insurance.  This was remarkable because Ameritas wanted to end the relationship with IBM Global Services and was considering changing to Microsoft software for a solution.  Winning this engagement was instrumental in demonstrating to Sogeti that the alliance could help them in all situations, even in competitive situations against another arm of IBM.",
				"I helped Sogeti win a software and services engagement at Vault.com.  This deal, worth approximately $500,000 in software revenue to IBM, established a relationship with Vault.com.  Prior to this Vault.com, was using open source software such as Apache, Tomcat, and MySQL to run their entire site.  Initially Vault.com wanted to use a Microsoft solution to completely revamp their website and business.  I worked with Sogeti and the IBM Sales team, and together we were able to win them over to an IBM content management solution and established a fruitful relationship for all three parties.",
				"I worked with Capgemini and Sogeti to open SOA Centers of Excellence to help them showcase their skills and talents alongside IBM Software solutions to potential customers.",
				"I recertified as an IBM Certified IT Specialist in April 2008.",
				"I worked with a colleague to develop a custom enablement of WebSphere Commerce for Sogeti consultants.  This enablement was taught in off hours to allow for maximum participation by Sogeti consultants.  The enablement was delivered by VM Image and taught via web meetings and conference calls.  This was one of the most successful enablements to date with Sogeti consultants."
